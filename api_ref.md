## API Reference

Module **prototype**

* **open_qemu_mode**( *vm_name=None* )

    Open qemu with image located at *image_path* in qemu mode.  It opens VNC on port 1, creates a TCP tunnel for qemu control on port *qemu_ctrl_port*, and forwards host port *ssh_fwd_port* to guest port 22 (the default SSH port).

    If *vm_name* is set, it also preloads the snapshot named *vm_name*.

* **open_s2e_mode**( *vm_name=None* )

    This method like open_qemu_mode() except that it opens qemu in s2e mode. In addition, it loads s2e configure file located at *configure_file_path* and actives s2e verbose mode.

* **control_qemu**( *cmd* )

    Control qemu by sending the command *cmd* to it. One call for one command.

* **ssh_guest**( *cmd*, *s2e_mode=False*, *iden_file=None*, *retry_n=3* )

    Control guest vm by sending the command *cmd* to it. Like control_qemu(), one call for one command.

    Defaultly this method is used in qemu mode. If you use it in s2e mode, set *s2e_mode* to True.

    You can specify SSH identity file by setting *iden_file*.

    If SSH connection failed, it will retry *retry_n* times.

* **scp_guest**( *item_path*, *is_directory=False*, *base_dir=home_dir*, *retry_n=3* )

    Copy the item located at *item_path* of host vm to guest vm by SCP. If the item is a directory, set *is_directory* to True. The *item_path* is related to *base_dir*. One item (or directory) for one call.

    Like ssh_guest(), if SCP connection failed, it will retry *retry_n* times.
